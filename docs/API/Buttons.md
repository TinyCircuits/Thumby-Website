# Button Input

There are 6 total individual buttons available to use as input for Thumby. 4 directional buttons for up, down, left, and right, and there are two action buttons. Multiple buttons can be combined to add more button actions to gameplay.

Use the `.pressed()` functions to detect if a button is actively being pressed - this function will detect the button press continuously. Use the `.justPressed()` functions for a single button press and not continuously - for example, when navigating a menu you want the menu to move once per button click.

### Objects

* `thumby.buttonA` | for accessing A button (right red button)
* `thumby.buttonB` | for accessing B button (left red button)
* `thumby.buttonU` | for accessing Up direction on d-pad
* `thumby.buttonD` | for accessing Down direction on d-pad
* `thumby.buttonL` | for accessing Left direction on d-pad
* `thumby.buttonR` | for accessing Right direction on d-pad
* `thumby.buttonMaskA` | button mask for the A button (literally the integer 32)
* `thumby.buttonMaskB` | button mask for the B button (literally the integer  16)
* `thumby.buttonMaskU` | button mask for the Up direction (literally the integer  4)
* `thumby.buttonMaskD` | button mask for the Down direction (literally the integer  8)
* `thumby.buttonMaskL` | button mask for the Left direction (literally the integer 1)
* `thumby.buttonMaskR` | button mask for the Right direction (literally the integer 2)

### Methods
* `thumby.buttonX.pressed()` 
    * Returns True if `thumby.buttonX` is currently pressed
    * Returns False otherwise (replace `buttonX` by any of the above button objects)
* `thumby.buttonX.justPressed()`
    * Returns True if `buttonX` was newly pressed on the thumby in the current frame update.
    * Returns False otherwise (replace `buttonX` by any of the above button objects)
* `inputPressed()`
    * Returns true if any buttons are currently pressed on the thumby.
* `inputJustPressed()`
    * Returns true if any buttons were newly pressed on the thumby since `thumby.display.update()` was last called.
* `dpadPressed()`
    * Returns true if any d-pad buttons are currently pressed on the thumby.
* `dpadJustPressed()`
    * Returns true if any d-pad buttons were newly pressed on the thumby since `thumby.display.update()` was last called.
* `actionPressed()`
    * Returns true if either action button is pressed on the thumby.
* `actionJustPressed()`
    * Returns true if either action button was newly pressed on the thumby since `thumby.display.update()` was last called.
* `isPressed(mask)`
    * Returns true if any of the buttons in the button mask are currently pressed on the thumby.
* `isJustPressed(mask)`
    * Returns true if any of the buttons in the button mask were newly pressed on the thumby since `thumby.display.update()` was last called.

### Example with Graphics

This example uses an instance of a Sprite object and some rectangles to create the outline of the direction-pad button, and the two action button outlines, respectively. When each button is pressed, the corresponding letter of the button is printed inside the button outlines to show a nice visual display triggered by buttons being pressed. You can press each button individually, or all of the buttons at once for this example.
