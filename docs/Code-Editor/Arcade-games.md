# Download Arcade Games to Thumby

This tutorial will show you how to download and add games to your Thumby hardware from the Arcade in the [**Thumby Editor Code Editor**](https://code.thumby.us/ "Thumby Editor")! 

*Go through the [**Getting Started with Thumby Tutorial**](https://tinycircuits.com/blogs/learn/thumby-getting-started-tutorial "Thumby getting started tutorial") before continuing with this tutorial so that you are familiar with how to emulate games and how to connect your Thumby to the Code Editor.*

## Playing Thumby Games

Before you download games to your Thumby, you can play test them in the Web Code Editor using the **Emulator**. You can directly click the Thumby buttons in the Emulator with your mouse to play games, or you can use the 'w', 'a', 's'. 'd' keys for the d-pad, and the ',', '.' (command and period) keys for the A and B action buttons.

Thumby games are added to the Arcade by wonderful & cool Thumby users that wanted to share the games they made. (Thank you game developers!!)

A few mentions of awesome game developers:
