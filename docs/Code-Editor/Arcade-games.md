## Playing Thumby Games

Before you download games to your Thumby, you can play test them in the Web Code Editor using the **Emulator**. You can directly click the Thumby buttons in the Emulator with your mouse to play games, or you can use the 'w', 'a', 's'. 'd' keys for the d-pad, and the ',', '.' (command and period) keys for the A and B action buttons.

Thumby games are added to the Arcade by wonderful & cool Thumby users that wanted to share the games they made. (Thank you game developers!!)

A few mentions of awesome game developers:
