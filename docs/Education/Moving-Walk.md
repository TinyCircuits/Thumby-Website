# Walk Animation

A walk cycle animation consists of a few or several different frames of the movements involved in walking. For a 2-legged human, there may be 2 frames of the right leg moving forward as the left leg moves further back. With different sprites that may have more legs or none at all, you may have to get creative with a walking animation!

Here's an example of a simple cat walking:

```py
import thumby

# catFeetTogether = bytearray([243,133,135,231,231,128,129,248])
catFootForward = bytearray([243,133,135,231,231,128,193,184])
catFeetForward = bytearray([243,133,199,167,231,128,193,184])
catSplit = bytearray([177,199,199,167,231,128,225,152])
catFrontSplit =bytearray([179,197,135,231,167,192,193,184])
catFeetBack = bytearray([179,197,135,231,167,192,129,248])
catBackFootTail = bytearray([179,197,197,167,167,192,129,248])

# Make a sprite object including all the walking cat frames
catSpr = thumby.Sprite(8, 8, catFootForward+catFeetForward+catSplit+catFrontSplit+catFeetBack+catBackFootTail, 28, 32)

# Counter that will be used to point to different walking animation frames
catSprCtr = 0

# Set the FPS (without this call, the default fps is 30)
thumby.display.setFPS(8)

while(True):
    thumby.display.fill(1) # Fill canvas to white

    # Display the sprite frames & increase the frame counter
    catSpr.setFrame(catSprCtr)
    thumby.display.drawSprite(catSpr)
    catSprCtr += 1
    thumby.display.update()
```

## Moving Background

With just the walking animation, it doesn't look like the cat is actually walking anywhere. With a moving, or scrolling, background we can add more movement to the scene. Here's a scrolling background that uses two full length screen Sprites (Thumby's screen is 72 pixels wide) that are displayed next to each other to look like one long background:

## Walking Animation On Moving Background

Together, the walking animation on a scrolling background can achieve the full effect of a sprite moving during gameplay:
