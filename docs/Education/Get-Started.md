# Thumby Examples & Education

Welcome to the educational part of the Thumby docs! Here, you will find some great building blocks and examples of standalone game components without needing to detangle these concepts from full games.

If you plan on using Thumby in an educational context, such as a high school classroom, please get in touch with us for any questions. <a href="https://tinycircuits.com/pages/contact-us" target="_blank" alt="Send a message to tinycircuits support on this page">**Send a message to us here**</a>!
